# self-driving-car-ASURT_AI
ASURT AI workshop perception/ Deep learning project: self driving car using Udacity Simulator

# Project Description
In this project, we use a neural network to clone car driving behaviour. It is a supervised regression problem between the car steering angle, throttle, and the road images in front of the car.

Those images were taken from three different camera angles (from the centre, the left, and the right of the car).

The goal is to build a Neural Network Model using Pytorch Fram Work that takes the three Images and outputs the steering angle and the throttle the car must take
